9. Business Logic in Models
The best place to allocate business logic for your project is in models, namely method models and model manager. It is possible that method models can only provoke some methods/functions. If it is inconvenient or impossible to allocate logic in models, you need to replace its forms or serializers in tasks.

ni = NextInvoice.objects.filter(code='BD') --returns query set to related store...eg BD

can be dispayed with forloop:
	for i in ni:
		print i or print str(i)
